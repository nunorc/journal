#### Loop functions

* lapply — loop over list and apply a function to each element
* sapply — same as apply but try to simplify result
* apply — apply a function over the margins of an array
* tapply — apply a function over  subsets of vectors
* mapply — multivariate version of apply

Other:

* split — splits objects
* apply to matrix x by column: > apply(x, 2, mean)
* apply to matrix x by row: > apply(x, 1, sum) — calculate the sum per row
